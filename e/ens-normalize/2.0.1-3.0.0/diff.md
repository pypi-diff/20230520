 ## Glossary
 
-* name - a full domain name, e.g. `nick.eth`
-* label - a part of a name separated by a dot, e.g. `nick` and `eth` are labels in `nick.eth`
-* normalized name - name that is already in normalized form according to the ENS Normalization Standard
-* normalizable name - name that is normalized or that can be converted into a normalized name using `ens_normalize`
-* disallowed name - name that is not normalized or normalizable
-* curable name - name that may be disallowed but can still be converted into a normalized name using `ens_cure`
-* fatal error - a `DisallowedNameError` object thrown by `ens_normalize` that contains only general information about the error and no possible fixes
-* curable error - a `CurableError` object (inherits from `DisallowedNameError`) thrown by `ens_normalize` that contains information about a possible fix for the error
+**Foundations**
+* **sequence** - a Unicode string containing any number of characters.
+* **label separator** - a full stop character (also known as a period), e.g. `.` .
+* **label** - a sequence of any length (including 0) that does not contain a label separator, e.g.  `abc` or `eth`.
+* **name** - a series of any number of labels (including 0) separated by label separators, e.g. `abc.eth`.
+
+**Names**
+* **normalized name** - a name that is in normalized form according to the ENS Normalization Standard. This means `name == ens_normalize(name)`. A normalized name always contains at least 1 label. All labels in a normalized name always contain a sequence of at least 1 character.
+* **normalizable name** - a name that is normalized or that can be converted into a normalized name using `ens_normalize`.
+* **beautiful name** - a name that is normalizable and is equal to itself when using `ens_beautify`. This means `name == ens_beautify(name)`. For all normalizable names `ens_normalize(ens_beautify(name)) == ens_normalize(name)`.
+* **disallowed name** - a name that is not normalizable. This means `ens_normalize(name)` raises a `DisallowedSequence`.
+* **curable name** - a name that is normalizable, or a name in the subset of disallowed names that can still be converted into a normalized name using `ens_cure`.
+* **empty name** - a name that is the empty string. An empty name is disallowed and not curable.
+* **namehash ready name** - a name that is ready for for use with the ENS `namehash` function. Only normalized and empty names are namehash ready. Empty names represent the ENS namespace root for use with the ENS `namehash` function. Using the ENS `namehash` function on any name that is not namehash ready will return a node that is unreachable by ENS client applications that use a proper implementation of `ens_normalize`.
+
+**Sequences**
+* **unnormalized sequence** - a sequence from a name that is not in normalized form according to the ENS Normalization Standard.
+* **normalization suggestion** - a sequence suggested as an in-place replacement for an unnormalized sequence.
+* **normalizable sequence** - an unnormalized sequence containing a normalization suggestion that is automatically applied using `ens_normalize` and `ens_cure`.
+* **curable sequence** - an unnormalized sequence containing a normalization suggestion that is automatically applied using `ens_cure`.
+* **disallowed sequence** - an unnormalized sequence without any normalization suggestion.
+
+The following Venn diagram is not to scale, but may help to communicate how some of the classifications of names relate to each other conceptually.

 ### Update this library to the latest ENS normalization specification *(optional)*
 
 This library uses files defining the normalization standard
 directly from the [official Javascript implementation](https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js/tree/main/derive).
 When the standard is updated with new characters, this library can
 be updated by running the following steps:

+  *  Thanks to [Adraffy](https://github.com/adraffy) for his leadership in coordinating the definition of this standard with the ENS community.
+  *  This library is being maintained by the team at [NameHash](https://namehash.io).
+* Passes **100%** of the [official validation tests](https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js/tree/main/validate) (validated automatically with pytest on Linux, MacOS, and Windows, see below for details).
 * Passes an [additional suite of further tests](/tools/updater/update-ens.js#L54) for compatibility with the official [Javascript reference implementation](https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js) and code testing coverage.
 * Based on [JavaScript implementation version 1.9.0](https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js/tree/4873fbe6393e970e186ab57860cc59cbbb1fa162).
 
 ## Glossary
 
-* name - a full domain name, e.g. `nick.eth`
-* label - a part of a name separated by a dot, e.g. `nick` and `eth` are labels in `nick.eth`
-* normalized name - name that is already in normalized form according to the ENS Normalization Standard
-* normalizable name - name that is normalized or that can be converted into a normalized name using `ens_normalize`
-* disallowed name - name that is not normalized or normalizable
-* curable name - name that may be disallowed but can still be converted into a normalized name using `ens_cure`
-* fatal error - a `DisallowedNameError` object thrown by `ens_normalize` that contains only general information about the error and no possible fixes
-* curable error - a `CurableError` object (inherits from `DisallowedNameError`) thrown by `ens_normalize` that contains information about a possible fix for the error
+**Foundations**
+* **sequence** - a Unicode string containing any number of characters.
+* **label separator** - a full stop character (also known as a period), e.g. `.` .
+* **label** - a sequence of any length (including 0) that does not contain a label separator, e.g.  `abc` or `eth`.
+* **name** - a series of any number of labels (including 0) separated by label separators, e.g. `abc.eth`.
+
+**Names**
+* **normalized name** - a name that is in normalized form according to the ENS Normalization Standard. This means `name == ens_normalize(name)`. A normalized name always contains at least 1 label. All labels in a normalized name always contain a sequence of at least 1 character.
+* **normalizable name** - a name that is normalized or that can be converted into a normalized name using `ens_normalize`.
+* **beautiful name** - a name that is normalizable and is equal to itself when using `ens_beautify`. This means `name == ens_beautify(name)`. For all normalizable names `ens_normalize(ens_beautify(name)) == ens_normalize(name)`.
+* **disallowed name** - a name that is not normalizable. This means `ens_normalize(name)` raises a `DisallowedSequence`.
+* **curable name** - a name that is normalizable, or a name in the subset of disallowed names that can still be converted into a normalized name using `ens_cure`.
+* **empty name** - a name that is the empty string. An empty name is disallowed and not curable.
+* **namehash ready name** - a name that is ready for for use with the ENS `namehash` function. Only normalized and empty names are namehash ready. Empty names represent the ENS namespace root for use with the ENS `namehash` function. Using the ENS `namehash` function on any name that is not namehash ready will return a node that is unreachable by ENS client applications that use a proper implementation of `ens_normalize`.
+
+**Sequences**
+* **unnormalized sequence** - a sequence from a name that is not in normalized form according to the ENS Normalization Standard.
+* **normalization suggestion** - a sequence suggested as an in-place replacement for an unnormalized sequence.
+* **normalizable sequence** - an unnormalized sequence containing a normalization suggestion that is automatically applied using `ens_normalize` and `ens_cure`.
+* **curable sequence** - an unnormalized sequence containing a normalization suggestion that is automatically applied using `ens_cure`.
+* **disallowed sequence** - an unnormalized sequence without any normalization suggestion.

 The package is available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ens-normalize/)
 
 ```bash
 pip install ens-normalize

+# raises DisallowedSequence for disallowed names
+# output is namehash ready
 ens_normalize('Nick.ETH')
 # 'nick.eth'
-# note: does not enforce .eth TLD 3-character minimum
+# note: ens_normalize does not enforce any constraints that might be applied by a particular registrar. For example, the registrar for names that are a subname of '.eth' enforces a 3-character minimum and this constraint is not enforced by ens_normalize.

 ### Update this library to the latest ENS normalization specification *(optional)*
 
 This library uses files defining the normalization standard
 directly from the [official Javascript implementation](https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js/tree/main/derive).
 When the standard is updated with new characters, this library can
 be updated by running the following steps:
