-## Quick Start
+# Quick Start
 
-### Installation
+### Prereq Installs
+You'll need `brew`, `git`, and Python 3.11 to get started. We have a setup script to install those and help you get your environment to the XDG spec under <b>Locally</b> or you can just use our docker image, [jessebot/onboardme](https://hub.docker.com/r/jessebot/onboardme).
+
+<details>
+  <summary>Local prereq install script</summary>
 
-#### Locally
 The quickest way to get started on a fresh macOS or distro of Debian (including Ubuntu) is:
 ```bash
 # this will download setup.sh to your current directory and run it
 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/setup.sh)"
 ```
 
-Linux: source your `.bashrc` like:
+#### Linux
+Source your updated `.bashrc`:
+
 ```bash
 # for linux
 source ~/.bashrc
 ```
 
-MacOS: source your `.bash_profile` like:
+#### MacOS
+source your updated `.bash_profile`:
+
 ```bash
 bash
 source ~/.bash_profile
 ```
 
-Now you can run `onboardme` ðŸŽ‰
+You will still have to set your default shell to BASH to if you want to take advantage of the default dot files for onboardme. You can do that like this:
+
 ```bash
-# this will display the help text for onboardme
-onboardme --help
+brew install bash
+sudo -i
+
+# if you're on an M1 or newer:
+echo "/opt/homebrew/bin/bash" >> /etc/shells && exit
+chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash $(whoami)
+
+# if you're on a mac earlier than the M1:
+echo "/usr/local/bin/bash" >> /etc/shells && exit
+chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash $(whoami)
 ```
 
-If you've already got brew and Python3.11 on your machine, you can just do:
+After that, you can also set the shell directly in your terminal app via the settings.
 
-```bash
-# should also work with pipx, if you'd like to use that instead
-pip install --user --upgrade onboardme
-```
+</details>
 
-You can read more in depth at the [Getting Started Docs] ðŸ’™! There's also more [docs] on basically every program that onboardme touches.

 To run the image locally with onboardme installed and already run using default settings:
+
 ```bash
 # this image is built daily and has already run onboardme with the default settings
 docker run jessebot/onboardme:latest /bin/bash
 ```
 
 To run the image locally with onbaordme installed but _not_ run:
+
 ```bash
 # best if you have your own dot files, or need a smaller initial docker image to pull
 # no packages outside of the required pre-reqs for onboardme have been installed
 docker run jessebot/onboardme:no-install /bin/bash

+```bash
+# this will display the help text for onboardme
+onboardme --help
+
+# Running this won't overwrite any existing dot files, but it may add new ones.
+onboardme
+```
+
+From here, if you want to *completely wipe your existing dot files* for a fresh start with with `onboardme`, you can run:
+```bash
+# WARNING: This will overwrite your local dotfiles, including your .bashrc and .bash_profile
+# can also be done with: onboardme -O
+onboardme --overwrite
+```
+
+You can read more in depth at the [Getting Started Docs] ðŸ’™! There's also more [docs] on basically every program that onboardme touches.
+
 ### Upgrades
 If you're on python 3.11, you should be able to do:
 
 ```bash
 pip3.11 install --upgrade onboardme
 ```
 
 ### Configuration
 onboardme has lots of CLI options, but you can also use config files. You have to create these files for the time being.
 
-Config files are in `~/.config/onboardme/` (will use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, if defined). Examples below:
+Config files are in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/onboardme/`, <sub>or `~/.config/onboardme/` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not defined</sub>.

+and we highly recommend switching as neovim has a lot more features and a very
+active plugin community :) NeoVim maintains a guide on how to switch from vim
+[here](https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim.html#nvim-from-vim).  ### Easy `yaml`

- ## Quick Start ### Installation #### Locally The quickest way to get started
-on a fresh macOS or distro of Debian (including Ubuntu) is: ```bash # this will
-download setup.sh to your current directory and run it /bin/bash -c "$(curl -
-fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/setup.sh)" ```
-Linux: source your `.bashrc` like: ```bash # for linux source ~/.bashrc ```
-MacOS: source your `.bash_profile` like: ```bash bash source ~/.bash_profile
-``` Now you can run `onboardme` Ã°ÂŸÂŽÂ‰ ```bash # this will display the help text
-for onboardme onboardme --help ``` If you've already got brew and Python3.11 on
+ # Quick Start ### Prereq Installs You'll need `brew`, `git`, and Python 3.11
+to get started. We have a setup script to install those and help you get your
+environment to the XDG spec under Locally or you can just use our docker image,
+[jessebot/onboardme](https://hub.docker.com/r/jessebot/onboardme).  Local
+prereq install script The quickest way to get started on a fresh macOS or
+distro of Debian (including Ubuntu) is: ```bash # this will download setup.sh
+to your current directory and run it /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://
+raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/setup.sh)" ``` #### Linux
+Source your updated `.bashrc`: ```bash # for linux source ~/.bashrc ``` ####
+MacOS source your updated `.bash_profile`: ```bash bash source ~/.bash_profile
+``` You will still have to set your default shell to BASH to if you want to
+take advantage of the default dot files for onboardme. You can do that like
+this: ```bash brew install bash sudo -i # if you're on an M1 or newer: echo "/
+opt/homebrew/bin/bash" >> /etc/shells && exit chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash $
+(whoami) # if you're on a mac earlier than the M1: echo "/usr/local/bin/bash"
+>> /etc/shells && exit chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash $(whoami) ``` After that,
+you can also set the shell directly in your terminal app via the settings.
+jessebot/onboardme docker image To run the image locally with onboardme
+installed and already run using default settings: ```bash # this image is built
+daily and has already run onboardme with the default settings docker run
+jessebot/onboardme:latest /bin/bash ``` To run the image locally with onbaordme
+installed but _not_ run: ```bash # best if you have your own dot files, or need
+a smaller initial docker image to pull # no packages outside of the required
+pre-reqs for onboardme have been installed docker run jessebot/onboardme:no-
+install /bin/bash ```  ## Install If you've already got brew and Python3.11 on
 your machine, you can just do: ```bash # should also work with pipx, if you'd
-like to use that instead pip install --user --upgrade onboardme ``` You can
-read more in depth at the [Getting Started Docs] Ã°ÂŸÂ’Â™! There's also more [docs]
-on basically every program that onboardme touches. #### Docker To run the image

 GetÃ‚Â yourÃ‚Â dailyÃ‚Â driverÃ‚Â justÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â wayÃ‚Â youÃ‚Â likeÃ‚Â it,Ã‚Â fromÃ‚Â dotÃ‚Â files
-installation,Ã‚Â toÃ‚Â packageÃ‚Â installation, to other little features you didn't
+management,Ã‚Â toÃ‚Â packageÃ‚Â installation, to other little features you didn't
 know you needed,Ã‚Â `onboardme` intends to save
-youÃ‚Â timeÃ‚Â withÃ‚Â initializingÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â upgradingÃ‚Â yourÃ‚Â environment. ## Features
-### Keep your Dot Files Up To Date Across multiple systems `onboardme` can
-manage your [dot files] using a git by turning your home directory into a repo.
-We provide default dot files, so you don't have to manage them - The [default
-dot files] are open source, and the maintainers use these themselves - They
-cover a lot of common apps/tools you probably want anyway - They have
-consistent colorschemes accross different CLI/TUI programs Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Âƒ - They set all
-the helpful BASH aliases you could need (zsh support coming soon)  ### Package
-management We install and upgrade libraries and apps using common package
-managers.  onboardme provides a currated list of default packages - checkout
-the [default packages] - supports `brew`, `apt`, `snap`, `flatpak`, and `pip`
-(and you can add your own Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â„) - group together packages for different kinds
-of environments - onboardme provides default package groups: - default (no
-desktop GUI apps installed by default, always installed) - macOS (default apps
-for _macOS only_ apps, always installed on macOS) - gui (default GUI apps for
-Linux desktops, optionally installed) - devops (devops related tooling,
-optionally installed)  ### NeoVim Plugin Installtion and Updates onboardme
-keeps your neovim plugins installed and up to date with [lazy.nvim] under the
-hood.  Why no vim though? If you haven't already made the switch from Vim to
-[NeoVim], you can try out NeoVim today with `onboardme` :D We used to support
-both neovim _and_ vim, but these days none of the primary developers of this
-repo use pure vim anymore, so we can't ensure it's up to standards. All of your
-knowledge from vim is still helpful in neovim though, and we highly recommend
-switching as neovim has a lot more features and a very active plugin community
-:) NeoVim maintains a guide on how to switch from vim [here](https://neovim.io/
-doc/user/nvim.html#nvim-from-vim).  ### Easy `yaml` config files - [XDG Base
-Directory Spec] use for [config files](#configuration) - Uses
-`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/onboardme/config.yml` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/onboardme/
-packages.yml` ### Docker image for an on-the-go dev workspace The docker image
-is built daily or on push to main. The base image is `debian:bookworm`, but we
-will rollout support for Ubuntu down the line :) See the [docker](#docker)
-section for more info! ### Other useful (but optional) configurations - Enable
-touchID for sudo on macOS - Add your user to the docker group - Install
-nerdfonts (defaults to Hack and Symbols Only) - Set capslock to control (Ã°ÂŸÂšÂ§
-in the works) ### Screenshots  Example of onboardme --help

- ## Quick Start ### Installation #### Locally The quickest way to get started
-on a fresh macOS or distro of Debian (including Ubuntu) is: ```bash # this will
-download setup.sh to your current directory and run it /bin/bash -c "$(curl -
-fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/setup.sh)" ```
-Linux: source your `.bashrc` like: ```bash # for linux source ~/.bashrc ```
-MacOS: source your `.bash_profile` like: ```bash bash source ~/.bash_profile
-``` Now you can run `onboardme` Ã°ÂŸÂŽÂ‰ ```bash # this will display the help text
-for onboardme onboardme --help ``` If you've already got brew and Python3.11 on
+ # Quick Start ### Prereq Installs You'll need `brew`, `git`, and Python 3.11
+to get started. We have a setup script to install those and help you get your
+environment to the XDG spec under Locally or you can just use our docker image,
+[jessebot/onboardme](https://hub.docker.com/r/jessebot/onboardme).  Local
+prereq install script The quickest way to get started on a fresh macOS or
+distro of Debian (including Ubuntu) is: ```bash # this will download setup.sh
+to your current directory and run it /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://
+raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/setup.sh)" ``` #### Linux
+Source your updated `.bashrc`: ```bash # for linux source ~/.bashrc ``` ####
+MacOS source your updated `.bash_profile`: ```bash bash source ~/.bash_profile
+``` You will still have to set your default shell to BASH to if you want to
+take advantage of the default dot files for onboardme. You can do that like
+this: ```bash brew install bash sudo -i # if you're on an M1 or newer: echo "/
+opt/homebrew/bin/bash" >> /etc/shells && exit chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash $
+(whoami) # if you're on a mac earlier than the M1: echo "/usr/local/bin/bash"
+>> /etc/shells && exit chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash $(whoami) ``` After that,
+you can also set the shell directly in your terminal app via the settings.
+jessebot/onboardme docker image To run the image locally with onboardme
+installed and already run using default settings: ```bash # this image is built
+daily and has already run onboardme with the default settings docker run
+jessebot/onboardme:latest /bin/bash ``` To run the image locally with onbaordme
+installed but _not_ run: ```bash # best if you have your own dot files, or need
+a smaller initial docker image to pull # no packages outside of the required
+pre-reqs for onboardme have been installed docker run jessebot/onboardme:no-
+install /bin/bash ```  ## Install If you've already got brew and Python3.11 on
 your machine, you can just do: ```bash # should also work with pipx, if you'd
-like to use that instead pip install --user --upgrade onboardme ``` You can
-read more in depth at the [Getting Started Docs] Ã°ÂŸÂ’Â™! There's also more [docs]
-on basically every program that onboardme touches. #### Docker To run the image
-locally with onboardme installed and already run using default settings:
-```bash # this image is built daily and has already run onboardme with the
-default settings docker run jessebot/onboardme:latest /bin/bash ``` To run the
-image locally with onbaordme installed but _not_ run: ```bash # best if you
-have your own dot files, or need a smaller initial docker image to pull # no
-packages outside of the required pre-reqs for onboardme have been installed
-docker run jessebot/onboardme:no-install /bin/bash ``` ### Upgrades If you're
-on python 3.11, you should be able to do: ```bash pip3.11 install --upgrade
-onboardme ``` ### Configuration onboardme has lots of CLI options, but you can
-also use config files. You have to create these files for the time being.
-Config files are in `~/.config/onboardme/` (will use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, if
-defined). Examples below:  ~/.config/onboardme/config.yml ```yaml log: # Full
-path to a file you'd like to log to. Creates file if it doesn't exist file: ""
-# what level of logs to output (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) level: "INFO" # steps
-refer to a specific function in the list of functions we run steps: # these are
-mac specific steps Darwin: # clones dot files into home dir/git fetches updates
-for dot files - dot_files # install packages - packages # adds nerdfonts -
-font_setup # runs :Lazy sync to install all your plugins - neovim_setup # sets
-up touchID for sudo - sudo_setup # these are linux specific steps Linux: -
-dot_files - packages - font_setup - neovim_setup # add your user to the docker
-group - group_setup dot_files: # personal git repo URL for your dot files,
-defaults to jessebot/dot_files git_url: "https://github.com/jessebot/
-dot_files.git" # the branch to use for the git repo above, defaults to main
-git_branch: "main" # !CAREFUL: runs a `git reset --hard`, which will overwite/
-delete local files in ~ that # conflict with the above defined git repo url and
-branch. You should run # `onboardme -s dot_files` to get the files that would
-be overwritten overwrite: false # basic package config package: # Remove any of
-the below pkg managers to only run the remaining pkg managers managers: # these
-are macOS specific steps Darwin: - brew - pip3.11 # these are linux specific
-steps Linux: - brew - pip3.11 - apt - snap - flatpak # list of extra existing
-packages groups to install groups: - default # uncomment these to add them as

+commands _Now_ you can run `onboardme` Ã°ÂŸÂŽÂ‰ ```bash # this will display the
+help text for onboardme onboardme --help # Running this won't overwrite any
+existing dot files, but it may add new ones. onboardme ``` From here, if you
+want to *completely wipe your existing dot files* for a fresh start with with
+`onboardme`, you can run: ```bash # WARNING: This will overwrite your local
+dotfiles, including your .bashrc and .bash_profile # can also be done with:
+onboardme -O onboardme --overwrite ``` You can read more in depth at the
+[Getting Started Docs] Ã°ÂŸÂ’Â™! There's also more [docs] on basically every
+program that onboardme touches. ### Upgrades If you're on python 3.11, you
+should be able to do: ```bash pip3.11 install --upgrade onboardme ``` ###
+Configuration onboardme has lots of CLI options, but you can also use config
+files. You have to create these files for the time being. Config files are in
+`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/onboardme/`, or `~/.config/onboardme/` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
+is not defined. | Config File | Description | |:-------------------------------
+-----------|:----------------------------------------------------| |
+`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/onboardme/config.yml` | For step configuration to run either
+all steps, or just a subset. | | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/onboardme/packages.yml` |
