 ```bash
 # this will download setup.sh to your current directory and run it
 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/setup.sh)"
 ```
 
+Linux: source your `.bashrc` like:
+```bash
+# for linux
+source ~/.bashrc
+```
+
+MacOS: source your `.bash_profile` like:
+```bash
+bash
+source ~/.bash_profile
+```
+
 Now you can run `onboardme` ðŸŽ‰
 ```bash
 # this will display the help text for onboardme
 onboardme --help
 ```
 
 If you've already got brew and Python3.11 on your machine, you can just do:
 
 ```bash
 # should also work with pipx, if you'd like to use that instead
-pip install --user onboardme
+pip install --user --upgrade onboardme
 ```
 
 You can read more in depth at the [Getting Started Docs] ðŸ’™! There's also more [docs] on basically every program that onboardme touches.

 on a fresh macOS or distro of Debian (including Ubuntu) is: ```bash # this will
 download setup.sh to your current directory and run it /bin/bash -c "$(curl -

-image is built daily and has already run onboardme with the default settings
-docker run jessebot/onboardme:latest /bin/bash ``` To run the image locally
-with onbaordme installed but _not_ run: ```bash # best if you have your own dot
-files, or need a smaller initial docker image to pull # no packages outside of
-the required pre-reqs for onboardme have been installed docker run jessebot/
-onboardme:no-install /bin/bash ``` ### Upgrades If you're on python 3.11, you
-should be able to do: ```bash pip3.11 install --upgrade onboardme ``` ###
-Configuration onboardme has lots of CLI options, but you can also use config
-files. You have to create these files for the time being. Config files are in
-`~/.config/onboardme/` (will use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, if defined). Examples
-below:  ~/.config/onboardme/config.yml ```yaml log: # Full path to a file you'd
-like to log to. Creates file if it doesn't exist file: "" # what level of logs
-to output (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) level: "INFO" # steps refer to a specific
